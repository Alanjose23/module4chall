## Description

Ever needed a random password for a totally obscure site, well this password generator has got you covered. I use it personally with web subscriptions that I want to abuse the free trial of, but you can use it for so much more. By using this service you can add and create passwords from scratch using parameters you decide. If you want it long, get it long, and vice versa for passwords. It solves the fact that some passwords can be easily guessed by nefarious individuals. Never again! I learned specifically how to target html elements with this assignment and how to use the math random command more efficently.
